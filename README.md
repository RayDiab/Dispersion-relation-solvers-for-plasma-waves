This contains multiple solvers for the dispersion relation of plasma waves.

IBW_cold_electrons_plot: plots the dispersion function (which needs to be = 0) for the Ion Bernstein Wave (IBW) dispersion relation in the limit of cold electrons. 

IBW_cold_electrons_solve: solves the dispersion function for IBWs in the limit of cold electrons.

LH_PDI_dispersion: solves the PDI dispersion relation in the LH regime. This is a Python adaptation of a Fortran code by Takase and Porkolab.

fast_Wave_Disp: Solves the Fast Wave (FW) dispersion relation.
